# Rock-paper-scissor
A lightweight Python implementation of the classic Rock — Paper — Scissors game. The player competes against the computer. The game accepts user input (rock, paper, or scissors), validates it, then randomly selects the computer’s move and decides the winner. The game can run in rounds with a running score and offers an option to quit.
